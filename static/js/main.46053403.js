The design of the Meccans was to gather all the resources they could, and with an overwhelming force, to crush and annihilate Muhammad and his patty. To this end Abu Sufyin was leading a richly-laden caravan from Syria to Mecca. He called for armed aid from Mecca. The battle was fought in the plain of Back, about so miles south-west of Medina. The Muslim force consisted of only about 313 men, mostly unarmed, but they were led by Muhammad, and they were fighting for their Faith.

A failure in one field may turn out to be a success in another.","Discover your own tastes and aptitudes and try to follow the paths indicated by them instead of battering your heads against the stone walls of a hard world.","We seniors are ready to help you, but the initiative, the choice and responsibility must rest with you.","Some of you, there may be, who may have done wrong and perhaps suffered punishment. If you take your punishment in the right spirit, it may be a blessing for you. For our punishments are meant to be ameliorative, not vindictive.","My dear, dear students! You are all dear to me, whether brilliant or stupid, dull or average, good or below the standard of goodness which I want and expect. In many ways, known and unknown to you, I have tried to shape your character and thoughts. Try to take a more cultivated intellect, a larger heart, a fuller hope, a stronger will, and truer instincts as the legacies of your College life."]}};function
